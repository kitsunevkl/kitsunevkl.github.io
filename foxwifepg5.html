<br>
<p>The snow lady who was really a fox child, all unknowing, had placed a curse upon the demon lord the moment they were married, for she had dreams and a life she wished to live that was curtailed by her lord father. Not one of the demon lordâ€™s children inherited his fire, for all that the first child had seemed to- no, he had foxfire, which burned his flesh while he remained unknowing of his heritage, and bent easily to his will once he became a fox. The second child could resist the hottest of flames, but it was never tested because the demon lord saw the ice in her hands and called her useless. The third child, with his lightning quick mind, became highly favored by the wisest of doctors. His escape from the demon lord came in a letter from the divine palace of learning, ordering him to attend the lectures of the best and brightest.</p>
