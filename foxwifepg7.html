<h2>Part Seven</h2>

<a href="foxwifepg6.html">Part Six<a/>
<br>
<p>In time, the fourth child was sent away to apprentice under another lord, as the demon lord hoped to learn his rivals' skills and make their strengths his own. The fourth child froze over his flames with the strength of the hatred he harbored for his father, uncaring of the way his own skin shriveled and blackened in the cold. The lord who he was apprenticed under sought an audience with the Emperor, who was said to be blessed by the Sun Herself, to heal the fourth child of his frostbite. Nothing the lord nor the Emperor did could thaw ice as cold as the depths of space. However, the visit to the palace was not in vain, for at a single gentle touch from the Emperor’s sunflower child, the ice piercing the fourth child’s heart shattered. His strength was returned to him, for the sunflower child reminded the fourth child that he would never be a demon lord. Not a demon, not a snow lord, but the fox child of first snows and hearthfires.</p>

<p>One day in the woods, the foxwife heard a great commotion. Using all the stealth she learned in her time hunting for food, she snuck up on a great battle. A mighty golem of dirt fought against a group of smaller creatures. Certainly the great black dog was impressive, baying his directions to the rest in a voice that made the foxwife shudder with fear. The yūrei was peculiar, especially with her unusual red hair, and the antics of the two headed oni were entertaining, but it was the black fox with three twisting tails who kept the foxwife from fleeing from the clash. Could it be? It was! Her snow child, her fox-boy, brought back to life to seek vengeance against the demon lord, and thus alive and well in front of her. The black fox was very startled by the pure white fur of the foxwife who approached him after the battle, but it took only a moment to recognize his mother in another shape, and the two embraced.</p>
