<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part Four</h2>
<br>
<a href="foxwifepg3.html">Part Three<a/>
<br>
<p>The first child’s heart was crushed by his father’s rejection, and he desperately journeyed to the mountain top to find some way to make the demon lord love him again. A fox trick is far reaching indeed. A carp swam to a mountain top to become a dragon, and a boy who is really the grandchild of a fox- that boy burns to death and comes back screaming his challenge at the world, foxfire wreathing his paws and crowning his head, fur gleaming black as he ran between the trees. Black like smoke and soot, black like vengeance. The fox-boy ran as far and as fast as he could to find a place where his father’s might did not reach.</p>

<p>The snow lady (the fox child) was distraught, for her first child was assumed to be dead. Her snow child, for all that his hair was made of flames and sparks spilled from his fingertips instead of snowflakes. He was the one who could sit beside her in the garden and admire the frozen pond for hours without so much as a shiver. And now he was gone.</p>
<p>“Your fault!” The snow lady shrieked at the demon lord, pounding on his chest. “It is your fault my son is gone!” She wailed, lost in her grief. The snow lady struck the demon lord across the face hard enough to blind him in one eye, only to realize too late that it was her fourth child- the youngest, the perfect one- who was standing before her and not the demon lord at all. With one last scream of rage and fear, the snow lady turned on her heel and lept out the window. She landed on four paws, and the snow lady who was really a fox after all ran away as fast as she could into the woods, where she could not accidentally hurt her children again.</p>
