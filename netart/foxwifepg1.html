<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part One</h2>

<p>There once was a Lord with a wandering eye. His Lady-wife wept regularly at the red bridge over the river, for her husband might not be cruel but he was certainly faithless. One day a passing Fox witnessed the lady’s lament.</p>

<p>“I weep, for my husband does not love me, and spends his nights in other beds.” The Lady cried.</p>
<p>“Then you should not love your husband either.” Said the Fox, a mischievous smirk on his snout. Before the Lady’s amazed eyes, he became a beautiful man, the only tell of his origins a long glossy tail of russet fur. And for one night, the Lady’s bed was warm indeed, with the Fox for company.

<p> The Lady bore her Lord-husband a beautiful snow child, with white hair and eyes like storm clouds. They were happy for a time, though the snow child was full of perhaps a bit more mischief than her parents expected.

Until the time came when the snow child was a snow lady, and old enough to be courted.. </p>
