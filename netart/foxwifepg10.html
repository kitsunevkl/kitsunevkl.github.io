<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part Ten</h2>

<br>
<p>“Hello, father.” The black fox said, baby face twisting into a muzzle full of needle sharp teeth, burned skin hidden away again under glossy fur. For his hesitation the demon lord paid dearly, for the black fox slid a blade into his chest and carved his heart from his body.</p>
<p>“But you were supposed to be a demon even stronger than me, to become Emperor.” The demon lord said, gasping out his last breath with the black fox’s blade still in his chest.</p>
<p>“And you were supposed to love your children. Guess we both didn’t get what we wanted.” The black fox returned coolly, holding his father’s heart in his hands. His fox teacher watched warily, for a black fox is always the most dangerous at the moment they complete the destruction which brought them back to life. But the black fox only held the demon lord’s heart to his lips and took a hearty bite, letting the corpse fall to the ground.</p>

<p>In that moment, the black fox could have become an even greater monster than the demon lord could ever have dreamed of. But deep down, in his burned and blackened heart, the black fox was still his mother’s mischievous, flame crowned snow child. The foxwife’s prayers at the red gate were heard by the Lady of Harvests, for white foxes share a special connection to her. So in the very moment he could have become a demon, the black fox gave a great shudder and grew a fourth tail. His fur changed from black like soot and smoke to the same pure white as his mother. The Lady of Harvests saw him safely back to his mother, and eventually reunited the foxwife with all of her children; her fiery fox-boy, her snow-girl, her storm-boy, and her littlest fox child of snowflakes and candle flames.</p>
