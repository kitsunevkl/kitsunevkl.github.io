<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>

<a href="foxwifepg1.html">Part One<a/>
<br>
<p>There once was a demon lord, avaricious and full of fire. He made himself from ashes and cinders, stoked his own flames until he became a wildfire. He set his eyes on the throne of the land, but no matter how hard he tried, how many riches he acquired, how many foes he defeated, he could not claim it (for the demon lord did not understand that to claim the throne was to assume responsibility and care for all, and he was incapable of that). So he set his eyes on the other lords and their households, determining that if he could not sit the throne himself, his offspring would.</p>

<p>The demon lord and the snow lady were wed in the spring, and their first child was born when the snow was still heavy on the ground the following winter. The snow lady was much grieved, for she had wished to travel and see the world, not for her father to marry her to a warlord. Still, she loved her little boy with his hair of flame. And for a time all seemed as though it might work out (but a snow lady is not meant to be caged by a demon lord, and a Fox trick is far reaching indeed)</p>
