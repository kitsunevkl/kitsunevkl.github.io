<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>

<br>
<p>First, the black fox ambushed the demon lord with the spider’s dancing corpses. Being dead, they could not grow exhausted or truly be injured, although they could be reduced to ashes. The dancing corpses threw themselves at the demon lord for two days, until they were all ash on the wind- and the demon lord was wounded to mirror his fourth child, for the blow the foxwife meant to deal him finally landed across his face, taking one of his eyes with it. Second, the two faced oni sent out copies of the black fox, created through clever spells, to further wear down the demon lord. The copies were weak, but with the demon already injured the black fox’s fires began to take a toll on him, for they were imbued with righteousness.</p>

<p>Third, when the two headed oni was exhausted, the black fox and his teacher took the field themselves. The teacher was wily and creative, always using illusions to sneak up on the demon lord and deftly avoiding being hit in return. The black fox fought with all the strength he had worked hard to gain, with his fire and his illusions, and even, at last his shapeshifting. Fourth, the black fox struck the final blow when he took on the face he had abandoned long ago. Faced with his first child, with hair of flames and chubby cheeks covered in burns, even the demon lord hesitated for just a moment.</p>
