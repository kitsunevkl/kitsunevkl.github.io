<p>I ended up writing this little story because I had no idea how to create net art with images and html, but I had a story idea I had wanted to put to paper for a while, and this was the perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>While it is probably difficult to recognize unless you know my starting point, the content of the story is heavily based off of characters from the manga Boku no Hero Academia, making this a derivative and transfomrative work.</p>
<p>The concept was that each part is roughly a double-drabble, which is 200 words. I wasn't super exact, I admit, but it was a really challenging writing exercise. I am not naturally very concise.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun finding illustrative images, and I hope you liked it!</p>
