<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part Three</h2>
<br>
<a href="foxwifepg2.html">Part Two<a/>
<br>
<p>The snow lady (the fox child, all unknowing) was drawn beyond the limits of endurance by the demands of her demon lord husband. She wept bitterly, for what could a snow woman do to resist a demon lord with a crown of fire? Still, she prayed at night that he would never receive the prize he sought so fervently. She prayed that her children would be smart and strong enough to flee, and she prayed that one day the demon lord would be brought low by his own hubris.</p>

<p>The first child seemed perfect to the demon lord, with his hair of flames, but when he sought to learn to control them, his flesh burned. The demon lord tossed him aside, for what use was a demon who could not form his own flames into weapons? The second child was born with hair of snow, streaked with blood, and her motherâ€™s eyes of stormclouds. She too was thrown aside by the demon lord, for what use was a snow child with no resistance to the cold? The third child was born with a voice like thunder and a mind as sharp as lightning. He was tossed aside, for what use was strategy to a demon lord when it came from a boy with no fire? The fourth child was perfect.</p>
