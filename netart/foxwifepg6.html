<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part Six</h2>
<br>
<a href="foxwifepg5.html">Part Five<a/>
<br>
<p>Years passed, and children grew up. The foxwife hid away, venturing only to the shrines for news of the realm when she could not find enough mice and rats to sustain herself in the woods. The first child journeyed far and learned much, eventually apprenticing under another Fox in order to learn his magic. The second child wept just as bitterly as her mother before her, for she saw no way to heal her family. The third child slipped away from his father’s fortresses, and hid himself amongst the scholars. The fourth child suffered under the demon lord’s direct tutelage, slowly being carved into an instrument of his father’s will. A weapon to allow the demon lord to claim the throne of the land by force.</p>

<p>The first child, the black fox, harbored a secret wish. He was made for vengeance and blood, and he would see his father’s campaign across the land ended. Under the tutelage of an older Fox, he earned his second and third tails, granting him the use of illusory magic and shapeshifting, as well as his innate foxfire. He trained hard, for battling the demon lord would take cunning as well as strength. The black fox gained allies- a black dog made of grief, a two tailed neko, a kappa, his Fox teacher, and a monstrous horde of reanimated creatures puppeted by a spider. With his own and his allies' fearsome reputation, the black fox set out to bring down the demon lord once and for all.</p>
