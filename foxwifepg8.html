<h1>The Demon Lord and the Foxwife</h1>
<h2>Part Eight</h2>

<a href="foxwifepg7.html">Part Seven<a/>
<br>
<p> Fox tricks are long reaching indeed, and so it was that though he did not know it, the demon lord had lost any hope of his bloodline sitting the throne. And what was it that happened, to a Lady so distraught by her Lord-husband’s wandering eye that she laid with a Fox, who then stood by and let her daughter be sold against her will to a demon lord? Well, the mischievous Fox had the last laugh after all, for the Lady’s demure snow child turned out to be a just as mischievous foxwife. The Lord was punished for his greed with ever failing health, and so he would never learn that his daughter was not his daughter, or that she escaped the cage he placed her in, yip yipping in foxy laughter all the way into the woods. With her Lord dead, her daughter missing, and her grandchildren barred from her by the demon lord, the Lady fell into great despair and was never heard from again.</p>

<p>The black fox had trained long and hard to face the demon lord, and with the blessings of his allies he did not need to fight alone. When he set out at last, he took with him many of the spider’s dancing corpses, his Fox teacher, and the two headed oni to watch his back. The foxwife was much grieved by her son’s desire to face his father in battle, preferring to spend her life hiding in the forests and shrines than to ever set foot in the demon lord’s lands again, but eventually she understood that her son was not a white fox. He was a black fox, made for vengeance and blood, and she could no more keep him from his purpose than she could smother the demon lord’s flames herself. The foxwife watched her son go, and went to the red gate to pray for the Lady of Harvests to see her son to success.</p>
